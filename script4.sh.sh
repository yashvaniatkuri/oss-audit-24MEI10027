# Script 4  : Log File Analyzer
# Author    : ATKURI YASHVANI (24MEI10027)
# Course    : Open Source Software — CSE0002
# Software  : Git (chosen for OSS Audit)
# Purpose   : Reads a log file line by line, counts lines that
#             match a keyword, and displays the last 5 matches.
#             Accepts log file path and keyword as arguments.
# Usage     : ./script4_log_analyzer.sh <logfile> [keyword]
# Example   : ./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog error
# Date      : March 2026
# =============================================================

# --- USAGE CHECK ---
# If no arguments are given, print a usage message and exit
# $# holds the number of arguments passed to the script
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then

    echo ""
    echo "  If keyword is not provided, 'error' is used by default."

    exit 1    # Exit with code 1 to indicate incorrect usage

# --- VARIABLES ---
# $1 is the first command-line argument (log file path)
LOGFILE=$1

# $2 is the optional second argument; default to "error" if not provided
# The :- operator sets a default value if the variable is empty or unset
KEYWORD=${2:-"error"}

COUNT=0          # Counter for lines matching the keyword — starts at zero
