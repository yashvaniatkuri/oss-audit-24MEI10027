# Script 5  : Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author    : ATKURI YASHVANI (24MEI10027)
# Course    : Open Source Software — CSE0002
# Software  : Git (chosen for OSS Audit)
# Purpose   : Interactively collects answers to three questions
#             and generates a personalised open-source philosophy
#             statement, saved to a .txt file.
# Date      : March 2026

# --- ALIAS DEMONSTRATION (Comment) ---
# In bash, aliases let you create shorthand names for commands.
# For example:
#   alias ll='ls -la'        # ll now works like ls -la
#   alias gs='git status'    # gs now shows git status quickly
#   alias gcm='git commit -m' # gcm replaces a long git command
# Aliases are defined in ~/.bashrc for persistence across sessions.
# They embody the open-source philosophy of making tools work for you.
# (Aliases are shown here as a concept — not executed in this script.)
