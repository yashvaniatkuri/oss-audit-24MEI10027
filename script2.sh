# Course    : Open Source Software — CSE0002
# Software  : Git (chosen for OSS Audit)
# Purpose   : Checks if Git is installed, retrieves package info,
#             and prints open-source philosophy notes for a set
#             of well-known FOSS packages using a case statement.
# Date      : March 2026
